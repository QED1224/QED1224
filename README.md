### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm QED, a long-time Toontown player who enjoys writing about its history and mechanics. I've had, essentially, three distinct phases in my Toontown-playing career.

### Toontown Online (2005 - 2013)

I started playing Toontown in 2005 as *Super Fireball Thunderroni*, a brown dog that reached 128 Laff (when the max was 129). During this time, I had the opportunity to experience the prime of Toontown&mdash;a time when the game was still being actively developed and many of its most influential players were around.

(I've documented this time period [in some detail here](https://github.com/QED1224/Toontown-Resources/blob/master/Timeline/README.md).) 

I took a year off between 2007 and 2008, and then returned as *Glitch*[^1]. This toon was among the most unusual characters ever created: I made it after discovering the (arguably) rarest glitch in Toontown history[^2].

### Toontown Offline (2014 - 2015)

After Toontown Online closed in 2013, I became an active contributor to the first two releases of [Toontown Offline](https://toontownoffline.net/). In particular, I 

- Performed the original port of the game to macOS.
- Created the `~tp`, `~max`, and `~cogSuit` commands (among many others).
- Devised and contributed the first implementations of custom SOS cards and self-applicable Toon-up.

### Toontown Rewritten (2015 -)

I've played TTR off and on (mostly off) since 2015 as *Qed The Third*. During this time, I also co-authored the [`Toontown-Resources` guide](https://github.com/QED1224/Toontown-Resources), which notably introduced the terms `wakeupChance` and "attack mismatches" into the Toontown vernacular.

[^1]: My name was revoked shortly after I created the character and I became simply *Toon* until 2013, Toontown's final year, when I successfully requested a name change to *Reign*.
[^2]: [Rental Cannon Extra Laff](https://github.com/QED1224/Toontown-Resources/blob/master/Timeline/README.md#rental-cannon-extra-laff). I believe that I was the only person to know of this glitch during the life of TTO, and I was told via email that I was reported so much that they ignore-listed my account.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm QED, a long-time Toontown player who enjoys writing about its history and mechanics. I've had, essentially, three distinct phases in my Toontown-playing career.

### Toontown Online (2005 - 2013)

I started playing Toontown in 2005 as *Super Fireball Thunderroni*, a brown dog that reached 128 Laff (when the max was 129). During this time, I had the opportunity to experience the prime of Toontown&mdash;a time when the game was still being actively developed and many of its most influential players were around.

(I've documented this time period [in some detail here](https://github.com/QED1224/Toontown-Resources/blob/master/Timeline/README.md).) 

### Toontown Offline (2014 - 2015)

### Toontown Rewritten (2015 -)
